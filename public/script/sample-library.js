Aside from the scarily poor special effects, the climax still ranks as Ghostbusters' chief sticking point. The 3rd act lead-up drags and the rooftop showdown is never as out-and-out funny as anything in the first two acts. When this is all you have to complain about, then - ahem - Boo Hoo. The arrival of the skyscraper-height Stay Puft Marshmallow Man more than fills the final act's joke quotient and, frankly, the dodgy SFX weren't paraded around as the best of the best back then either. In the 30th anniversary re-release of this PG-rated modern classic comedy, three unemployed parapsychology professors (Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis) set up shop as a unique ghost removal service. From the get-go, this is Murray's vehicle--we're just riding in it. Sure, he's often more readily identified with Groundhog Day than this ensemble piece, but the actor's perfectly played performance as a dubious scientist - one who rarely takes anything seriously - never lets up with laughs. Seriously, root through the now-iconic scenes and dialogue to re-discover the rich wealth of one-liners he delivers at an almost machine gun clip. Reveling in showing audiences both oddball actors at the top of their game and literally otherworldly situations, Ivan Reitman's direction points up the academia and modern science-skewing humor in the script while making you wonder how this often biting flick could've ever only be rated PG. Bottom line: Who Ya Still Gonna Call?",

Now THAT is a Star Trek film. I was worried that 25 year-old rose tinted specs would mean I was disappointed by this one - no way. It has aged extremely well, as if two Starfleet vessels battling each other to the death could ever really get old anyway. It’s everything that Star Trek: The Motion Picture isn’t. Fast, fun, and full of action. I’d forgotten just how awesome Ricardo Montalban is as Khan, and how great Khan is as Kirk’s nemesis. The film builds to the incredible crescendo of the blind battle inside the nebula where Kirk finally gets the upper hand and cripples the Reliant, causing Khan to try to wipe the Enterprise out with the Genesis device. Spock’s sacrifice is brought to us brilliantly; it’s not overly dramatic, but the poignancy of the act comes across perfectly. 4.5/5, only failing to achieve full bananas due to a slightly weaker musical score and the obvious re-use of a couple of scenes from the first film. Nicholas Meyer did an outstanding job on this, and quite possibly saved Star Trek as a whole. Another bad outing after the first film could easily have meant curtains for the whole thing.",

In the quaint Irish town of Tullymore, an elderly pair of jokers, Jackie (Ian Banner) and Michael (David Kelly), discovers that one of the villagers has won the National Lottery's First Division. There's a problem though -- the villager in question is dead. That's when the two charming old scoundrels, concoct a scheme for posing as the deceased lotto winner in order to collect the prize. Of course this involves getting the entire village to go along with the scheme, and that is where all the fun begins. Although it is not exactly a hilarious film, there are moments where you will genuinely laugh. The first scene in particular when Ian Bannen wants his apple tart brought to him whilst watching the lotto results - hysterical. But it is also a heartwarming film, the perfect feel-good entertainment. Bannen, Kelly, and Fionnula Flanagan are the main stars; Bannen in particular is outstanding; striking just the right balance of humor and poignancy. However, the real star performer is Eileen Dromey as Lizzie Quinn, a cantankerous wheelchair-bound old woman, with no friends except her cats (and perfectly happy for it to remains the same). Everyone will recognize someone they know in the old bat, and her unbelievable rudeness will leave you laughing more with shock than anything. In the end, Waking Ned Devine is one of those charming and funny movies that you just can't help liking, great acting and witty dialogue propels this film.",

I HATED HOW THIS MOVIE WAS EDITED. At first, you'd get introductions for each story. Those intros are merely glimpses of each stories. After the glimpses, we'd jump back and forth from the 1800s to the 1930s, 70s, present day, the \"high-tech\" future and the apocalyptic future. This choice of editing bothered me throughout the entire film. I was unable to identify and connect with the characters. Also, because of the editing, I didn't spot the connections between the stories. I only noticed them after reading the film's plot on Wikipedia.",

This movie shows how to use science, a great script, and solid acting from Matt Damon to entertain audiences with a castaway story not seen before. Its perfect as its not too sci-fi and also not too much of a documentary feel, its as much of a real human experience it would be if one so happened to, with the right knowledge, end up stranded on our planetary neighbor Mars. Overall a great movie!",
